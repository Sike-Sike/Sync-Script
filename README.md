# Sync-Script

This script used to  sync the contents of one directory to another.

To run the script, first create a python environment which contains all the dependencies in requirements.txt.

Replace the ``path/to/python/environment`` by appropriate path to the python environment that was created.

Replace the ``path/to/sync.py`` by the actual path to sync.py

Replace ``path/to/source`` and ``path/to/destination`` in sync.py by the appropriate paths to source and destination.

Give execute permission to sync.sh by:
```    
    chmod +x ./sync.sh
```

Finally run the script by:
```
    ./sync.sh
```
